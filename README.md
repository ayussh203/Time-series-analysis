# Time-series-analysis
This project was undertaken during our training at the SeisData Processing and Interpretation Center (SPIC), ONGC, Mumbai. Its primary aim was to identify key areas of interest, pinpointing the precise location and depth of hydrocarbon wells in both onshore and offshore locations. This involved analyzing seismic data collected as time-series measurements.
